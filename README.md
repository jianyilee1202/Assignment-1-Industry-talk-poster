# Assignment-1-Industry-talk-poster
*This is the first assignment of technology and information system (SECP1513-09).*

**What I have gained:** (`・ω・´)

Through this assignment, I learnt how industry talks are conducted and the importance of these talks. I gained first-hand knowledge of current trends, challenges and innovations in the industry and learnt how to apply theoretical knowledge to real-life scenarios. I also understood more about the potential career opportunities in the industry and the skills required.

**My improvement:** (ง๑ •̀_•́)ง

In this assignment, I have improved my ability to understand the topics discussed during the talk. Besides that, I enhanced my thinking skills by analysing the key points shared by the speakers to determine what was the most relevant to my studies. In creating a poster, I learnt how to summarize key ideas, design creatively and provide accurate information.
